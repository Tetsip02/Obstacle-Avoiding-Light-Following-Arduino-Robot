\section{Problem}
A point-mass m is fixed to the end of a pole of length l and is connected to a cart via a free hinge. The cart is restricted to move in one dimension.
We want to apply a reinfrocement learning algorithm whose goal it is to balance the pole for as long as possible by accelerating the cart to the left or right direction.
